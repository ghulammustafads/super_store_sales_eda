## 1. Project Background
This project analyzes **Superstore sales performance** from **2014 to 2017**, covering a total revenue of **$2.3M** across **5,009 orders**. The goal is to transform raw sales data into meaningful business intelligence to support data-driven decisions for marketing, sales, and operations.

By analyzing **sales trends, profit drivers, and discount impacts**, the project identifies regions of high growth, evaluates category performance, and highlights areas where aggressive discounting is eroding profitability.

## 3. Executive Summary
The Superstore generated **$2,297,201 in total revenue** over the four-year period, achieving a **net profit of $286,397** and a profit margin of **12.5%**. The company demonstrated strong growth, with sales increasing by **51.4% from 2014 to 2017**, reflecting successful market expansion.

However, profitability challenges exist. While top-line growth is encouraging, **heavy discounting practices (exceeding 30%)** have significantly eroded margins. The **West region** dominates performance, contributing nearly 32% of total sales, while the **Technology category** remains the highest revenue driver. Conversely, the **Furniture category** shows suboptimal returns due to operational costs and discounting.

By analyzing this data, we have identified specific opportunities to **optimize discount strategies, reallocate resources to high-margin regions, and improve operational efficiency**.
